<h3>A chrome extension to make Hacker news more pleasing to the eye</h3>

<p>I didnt really like the way Ycombinator shows its hacker news so I thought I'd learn something by creating a chrome extension that injects some css onto their page!</p>
  <p>To install simply use the packed extension. </p>
